Hi Eminem enthusiasts!
<br>
The world’s first NFT drop from Eminem provides Stans, fans, NFT enthusiasts and collectors ONE OPPORTUNITY to own a piece from Eminem’s premier NFT drop. Born from the convergence of blockchain technology, creative enthusiasm, and pandemic doldrums, this drop was inspired by Eminem’s passion as a vintage toy, comic book and trading card collector that traces back to his childhood days as just “plain old Marshall”.  Make no mistake, this is a digital festival- modeled after the traditional “Con” gatherings where fans come together and trade their wares. You may not be able to get together with thousands of Stans in a poorly ventilated convention center somewhere on the outskirts of 8 Mile Rd., but this weekend you can rub elbows with each other right here on Nifty Gateway and own a piece of the collectible, non-fungible action!
